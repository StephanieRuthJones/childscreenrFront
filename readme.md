PROBLEM STATEMENT:

State and federal laws mandate that all preschool students receive speech-language screenings to determine whether they require school-based special services. 

Standardized screening tools are extremely expensive and do not always account for population differences. Free screening tools often have similar problems and do not provide any normative data for comparison.

ChildScreenr is a free, online assessment tool that screens preschoolers' skills in the areas of: receptive-expressive language; articulation; and social skills. Furthermore, it automates data analysis, providing speech-language pathologists with normative data specific to the population that they serve.
